I used this website to learn code for figuring out the greatest increase and greatest decrease in profits.

I also had a tutoring session to help with figuring out how to skip the header when calculating the changes in profit/loss from month to month. He also helped me resolve my issue of the program not being able to read the csv file even though the file path was correct.
